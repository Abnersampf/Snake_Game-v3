<h1>About the project</h1>

This is the final version of my series of attempts to make the snake game. This time I used my basic knowledge of object-oriented programming to create this game. I don't enjoy working with classes and other files (I do everything in the main method), but since I need to learn OOP, I had to try.

<h1>Game features:</h1>

- Snake can teleport.
- Game over added.
- Victory system added.
- Snake cannot move backwards.

<h1>Recommendations:</h1>

- Use dotnet 8.0 (or 6.0 and higher).
- Generate the .exe file, DO NOT run it in the Visual Studio Code terminal.
- Do not test on online compilers.
- I recommend using Visual Studio 2022.
